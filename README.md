ðŸ’»Project: Analysis of Uber pickups in Bengaluru using Python.


ðŸ’»Project Overview: 

Analysis of Uber pickups in Bengaluru based on hour of the day. It visualizes hourly mean travel time using a box and line plot. It also visualizes the lowest and highest travel time between source and destination pairs using a heatmap.


ðŸ“šLibraries used:

1. numpy: To perform numerical operations.
2. pandas: For reading the dataset and 
managing data frames.
3. matplotlib.pyplot: For creating visualizations.
4. seaborn: For enhancing visualizations with various themes and color palettes.


ðŸ“ˆVisualization:

1. Line Graph for Hourly Mean Travel Time: A line graph will depict the hourly variations in mean travel time using Seabornâ€™s line plot. 

2. Box Plot for Hourly Mean Travel Time: A box plot will help visualize the distribution of travel times during each hour of the day, showing the median, quartiles, and outliers.

3. Heatmap for Source-Destination Travel Time: A heatmap will display the areas of high or low travel time between source-destination pairs.


ðŸŽ¯Conclusion:
This project provides a thorough analysis of Uber data using Python, focusing on exploring hourly travel time trends and the travel time relationship between source and destination locations. Through visualizations like line plots, box plots, and heatmaps, key insights into travel patterns in Bengaluru can be derived, offering potential for further analysis and optimization in ride-sharing services
